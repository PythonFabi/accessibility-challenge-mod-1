## Description

The marketing agency Horiseon, with the mission to improve your brand for Search Engine Optimization(SEO) and brand growth, has a great looking website. 
The only feature that was missing was Accessibility. Now, the website has great code that meets the accessibility criteria, is well structured and well functioning. 
This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about accessibility, even by watching the code you will learn!
